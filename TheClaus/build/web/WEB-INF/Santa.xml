                            Santa Claus is often described as a large man with a long white beard in scarlet robes lined with fur. 
                            He typified the spirit of good cheer at Christmas, bringing peace, joy, good food and wine and revelry. 
                            The Victorian revival of Christmas included Father Christmas as the emblem of 'good cheer'. 
                            His physical appearance was variable, with one famous image being John Leech's illustration of the "Ghost of Christmas Present" in Charles Dickens's festive classic A Christmas Carol (1843), as a great genial man in a green coat lined with fur who takes Scrooge through the bustling streets of London on the current Christmas morning, sprinkling the essence of Christmas onto the happy populace

                        <Story>Rudolf is a reindeer with a glowing red nose, popularly known as "Santa's 9th Reindeer." When depicted, he is the lead reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve.
                              The luminosity of his nose is so great that it illuminates the team's path through inclement winter weather.
